Ha412HOChr05g00015311	SAM208	SAM208	SAM208	No Change	No Change	No Change	The gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP82C. It is involved in the early Fe deficiency response.CYP82C4 hydroxylates fraxetin to generate sideretin (5-hydroxyfraxetin). Fraxetin and sideretin are catecholic coumarins secreted into the rhizosphere under conditions of low iron availability and help mobilize this nutrient from insoluble iron(III) pools in the soil.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
